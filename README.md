#### Branch naming

Branch names must respect the pattern `type/description-of-the-change`.

*Type* must be one of the following:

* `chore` for changes not related to the Kotlin source code, for example a change in the build config
* `doc` for changes related to source code documentation, or external document, like the README
* `feat` for a new feature for the app
* `fix` for bug fixes
* `refactor` for improving one or more unit of code, without impacting the behaviour of the app
* `test` for everything related to test ( add a new test suite, add a new test into an already existing test suite or improve/modify the performance or the behaviour of an already existing test )

_description of change_ must be a concise and meaningful description of what is expected by the change apported; words must be separated by a dash `-`

The whole name of the branch must be lower case.

#### Code style and pattern
Make sure, you run `./gradlew ktlintformat` before your pull request.
